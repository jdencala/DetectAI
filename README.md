Traffic accidents are becoming increasingly frequent due to several reasons. One of them is aggressive driving in cities or highways. 
This aggressive driving includes some factors such as speeding, hard braking, and sudden left or right turns.

Our present project will attempt to predict the aggressive behaviors of a driver using deep learning techniques.

Libs requirements:

```
torch==1.9.0
torchvision==0.10.0
pandas==1.3.3
numpy==1.21.2
seaborn==0.11.2
matplotlib==3.5.0
sklearn==0.24.2
```
